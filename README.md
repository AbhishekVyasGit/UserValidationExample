## UserValidationExample =>

 **validations are used to validate post form fields to ensure that whatever we need is present in the way we want it to be present
 and even though you guys are used to doing frontend validations but still validations must be performed on backend also as frontend code is available inside browser
  and user might modify it to bypass our validations hence backend validation is required**


## Express-Validator =>

**express-validator is a set of express.js middlewares that wraps the extensive collection of validator and
It allows you to combine them in many ways so that you can validate and sanitize your express requests, and 
offers tools to determine if the request is valid or not, which data was matched according to your validators, and so on.**
